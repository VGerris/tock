## Git (commits & merge requests)

To submit a feature or bugfix:

1. [Create an _issue_](https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock/issues/new):
    - Recommended format for the title:
        - `[Component] Title` where component might be 
    _Studio_, _Core_, _Doc_, etc. and title usually is like _Do or fix something_
2. [Create a _pull request_](https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock/pulls) and link it to the issue(s):
    - All commits should be [_signed_](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification) 
    - Please rebase and squash unnecessary commits (tips: PR can be tagged as _Draft_) before submitting
    - Recommended format for the branch name :
        - `ISSUEID_short_title`
    - Recommended format for the commit(s) message(s):
        - `resolves #ISSUEID Component: title` for features
        - `fixes #ISSUEID Component: title` for fixes
3. To be merged, a _pull request_ must pass the tests and be reviewed by at least two approvers
